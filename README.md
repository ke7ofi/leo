# Low Earth Orbit

LEO is a dense keyboard layout in the spirit of [Neo](http://neo-layout.org/) and the [space-cadet keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard).

## Design goals

### Compatibility

Anything that works on a standard US keyboard should work on LEO; there's no sense in breaking shortcuts people have been using for years.

### Convenience/carryover

Laptop keyboards never seem to agree on where things like arrow keys go, so it makes sense to provide a method of input that can be used identically on anything with a QWERTY layout. Additionally, everything important should be easy to reach and justified either by frequency or geometry.

### Density

There's no compelling reason not to provide as many characters as possible; while we probably don't need 8000 characters like on the original space-cadet keyboards, it certainly doesn't hurt to have some Greek letters and language-specific characters.
